# Digital Oscilloscope using STM32

A portable **digital oscilloscope** built around the STM32F091RC microcontroller and ILI9341 TFT display, developed as a final project for ECEN 5613 at the University of Colorado Boulder. It offers real-time waveform display, voltage and frequency measurement, and interactive settings adjustment—ideal for embedded systems learning and prototyping[attached_file:1].

## Overview

This oscilloscope project solves the problem of needing a bulky benchtop instrument by enabling signal monitoring anywhere. It provides core oscilloscope functions such as waveform capture, min/max/peak-to-peak voltage measurement, frequency calculation, and a full on-screen UI, all in a compact and affordable format[attached_file:1].

- **Real-time signal acquisition** with 12-bit ADC, up to 1 MSPS[attached_file:1]
- **DMA-based buffering** for efficient sampling without CPU load[attached_file:1]
- **240x320 color TFT SPI display** for waveform and UI[attached_file:1]
- **Voltage, frequency, and peak-to-peak voltage measurements** on-screen[attached_file:1]
- **User-adjustable parameters** via push buttons:
  - V/div (vertical sensitivity)
  - Time/div (horizontal timebase)
  - Trigger Level
  - Attenuation (e.g., 1x, 10x)[attached_file:1]
- **Grid and trace rendering** for oscilloscope-style visualization[attached_file:1]
- **Intuitive settings menu** for easy navigation and adjustment[attached_file:1]

## Getting Started

### Hardware

1. Connect display wires per the pinout above[attached_file:1].
2. Connect push buttons to GPIOs (using pull-ups and interrupts)[attached_file:1].
3. Make common ground across all connected modules[attached_file:1].
4. Use a signal/function generator as the signal input for best results[attached_file:1].

### Firmware

1. Load and open the provided firmware code (see appendices for code repository if available)[attached_file:1].
2. Build in STM32CubeIDE for the STM32F091RC target[attached_file:1].
3. Flash onto the microcontroller board[attached_file:1].

## Usage

- Navigate the settings menu using the hardware buttons.
- Adjust V/div, Time/div, trigger level, and attenuation on the fly.
- View real-time waveform traces and numeric signal measurements.
- Compare readings with standard oscilloscopes for verification[attached_file:1].

## Testing and Known Limitations

- Tested with sine, square, and triangle waves from a function generator[attached_file:1].
- Verified voltage and frequency on a commercial oscilloscope[attached_file:1].
- **Limitation:** Display refresh rate is slower than desired for high-speed signals; future improvements may include using a higher-sample-rate ADC[attached_file:1].
